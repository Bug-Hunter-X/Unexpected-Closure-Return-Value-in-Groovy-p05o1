This example demonstrates an uncommon error in Groovy related to the handling of return values from closures.  In Groovy, closures can return values. However, if a closure within a method returns a value, and that returned value isn't captured by the method, it can lead to unexpected behavior or silent failures if the calling code expects a certain result. This issue can be subtle and difficult to debug as no explicit error message occurs. The solution below shows how to correctly handle the return value from the closure.
